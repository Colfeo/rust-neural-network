# COBOL Neural Network for MNIST Classification

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project I've implemented a fully-functional two-layer neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model processes 28×28 grayscale images (784 pixels) and predicts digits 0-9.

Why RUST ? Why not ?

## 🧠 Network Architecture

The neural network features a simple yet effective structure:

- **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (one per pixel)
- **Hidden Layer**: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons with softmax activation

All implemented in pure RUST without external machine learning libraries.
